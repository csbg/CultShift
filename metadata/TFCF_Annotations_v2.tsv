Displays histone methyltransferase activity and monomethylates 'Lys-9' of histone H3 (H3K9me1) in vitro (By similarity). Probably catalyzes the monomethylation of free histone H3 in the cytoplasm which is then transported to the nucleus and incorporated into nucleosomes where SUV39H methyltransferases use it as a substrate to catalyze histone H3 'Lys-9' trimethylation (By similarity). Likely to be one of the primary histone methyltransferases along with MECOM/PRDM3 that direct cytoplasmic H3K9me1 methylation (By similarity). Functions in the differentiation of brown adipose tissue (BAT) which is specialized in dissipating chemical energy in the form of heat in response to cold or excess feeding while white adipose tissue (WAT) is specialized in the storage of excess energy and the control of systemic metabolism (By similarity). Together with CEBPB, regulates the differentiation of myoblastic precursors into brown adipose cells (By similarity). Functions as a repressor of TGF-beta signaling

This repression may be mediated at least in part by histone deacetylase activities which can associate with this corepressor. Involved in the repression of TFAP2A; impairs binding of BCL6 and KDM2B to TFAP2A promoter regions. Via repression of TFAP2A acts as a negative regulator of osteo-dentiogenic capacity in adult stem cells; the function implies inhibition of methylation on histone H3 'Lys-4' (H3K4me3) and 'Lys-36' (H3K36me2).

Jmjd6	CF						BRD4 & pTEFb		P1		Acts as a lysyl-hydroxylase that catalyzes 5-hydroxylation on specific lysine residues of target proteins such as U2AF2/U2AF65 and LUC7L2. Regulates RNA splicing by mediating 5-hydroxylation of U2AF2/U2AF65, affecting the pre-mRNA splicing activity of U2AF2/U2AF65 (PubMed:19574390). Hydroxylates its own N-terminus, which is required for homooligomerization (PubMed:22189873). In addition to peptidyl-lysine 5-dioxygenase activity, may act as an RNA hydroxylase, as suggested by its ability to bind single strand RNA (PubMed:20679243, PubMed:29176719). Also acts as an arginine demethylase which preferentially demethylates asymmetric dimethylation (PubMed:17947579, PubMed:24498420, PubMed:24360279). Demethylates histone H3 at 'Arg-2' (H3R2me) and histone H4 at 'Arg-3' (H4R3me), including mono-, symmetric di- and asymmetric dimethylated forms, thereby playing a role in histone code (PubMed:17947579, PubMed:24360279). However, histone arginine demethylation may not constitute the primary activity in vivo (PubMed:17947579, PubMed:21060799, PubMed:22189873). In collaboration with BRD4, interacts with the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) complex in its active form to regulate polymerase II promoter-proximal pause release for transcriptional activation of a large cohort of genes. On distal enhancers, so called anti-pause enhancers, demethylates both histone H4R3me2 and the methyl cap of 7SKsnRNA leading to the dismissal of the 7SKsnRNA:HEXIM1 inhibitor complex. After removal of repressive marks, the complex BRD4:JMJD6 attract and retain the P-TEFb complex on chromatin, leading to its activation, promoter-proximal polymerase II pause release, and transcriptional activation (PubMed:24360279). Demethylates other arginine methylated-proteins such as ESR1 (PubMed:24498420). Has no histone lysine demethylase activity (PubMed:21060799). Required for differentiation of multiple organs during embryogenesis.

Preferentially recognizes and cleaves monomethylated and dimethylated arginine residues of histones H2, H3 and H4 (PubMed:28847961). After initial cleavage, continues to digest histones tails via its aminopeptidase activity (PubMed:28847961). Additionally, may play a role in protein biosynthesis by modifying the translation machinery (PubMed:29915238). Acts as Fe(2+) and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent monoxygenase, catalyzing (S)-stereospecific hydroxylation at C-3 of 'Lys-22' of DRG1 and 'Lys-21' of DRG2 translation factors (TRAFAC), promoting their interaction with ribonucleic acids

May cause G2/M arrest and apoptosis in cancer cells.
Prdm9	CF					H3K4me3			P1		The protein encoded by this gene is a zinc finger protein with histone methyltransferase activity that catalyzes histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) during meiotic prophase. This protein contains multiple domains, including a Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) domain, an SSX repression domain (SSXRD), a PRD1-BF1 and RIZ homologous region, a subclass of SET (PR/SET) domain, and a tandem array of C2H2 zinc fingers. The zinc finger array recognizes a short sequence motif, leading to local H3K4me3, and meiotic recombination hotspot activity. The observed allelic variation alters the DNA-binding sequence specificity of the protein, resulting in distinct meiotic recombination hotspots amongst individuals and populations. Multiple alternate alleles of this gene have been described.
Prmt3	CF								P1		This gene belongs to the protein arginine methyltransferase (PRMT) family. The encoded enzyme catalyzes the methylation of guanidino nitrogens of arginyl residues of proteins.

Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants
Prmt9	CF								P1		This gene encodes a type II methyltransferase. Post-translational modification of target proteins by PRMTs plays an important regulatory role in many biological processes, whereby PRMTs methylate arginine residues by transferring methyl groups from S-adenosyl-L-methionine to the guanidino nitrogen atoms of arginine. The protein encoded by this gene methylates spliceosome associated protein 145 to regulate alternative splicing and acts as a modulator of small nuclear ribonucleoprotein maturation.

Key determinant of DSB repair pathway choice, as it commits cells to HR by preventing classical non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). Functions downstream of the MRN complex and ATM, promotes ATR activation and its recruitment to DSBs in the S/G2 phase facilitating the generation of ssDNA. Component of the BRCA1-RBBP8 complex that regulates CHEK1 activation and controls cell cycle G2/M checkpoints on DNA damage. During immunoglobulin heavy chain class-switch recombination, promotes microhomology-mediated alternative end joining (A-NHEJ) and plays an essential role in chromosomal translocations
Rbl1	CF								R.2		Key regulator of entry into cell division. Directly involved in heterochromatin formation by maintaining overall chromatin structure and, in particular, that of constitutive heterochromatin by stabilizing histone methylation. Recruits and targets histone methyltransferases KMT5B and KMT5C, leading to epigenetic transcriptional repression. Controls histone H4 'Lys-20' trimethylation. Probably acts as a transcription repressor by recruiting chromatin-modifying enzymes to promoters. Potent inhibitor of E2F-mediated trans-activation. Forms a complex with adenovirus E1A and with SV40 large T antigen
Rbl2	CF								R.2		Key regulator of entry into cell division. Directly involved in heterochromatin formation by maintaining overall chromatin structure and, in particular, that of constitutive heterochromatin by stabilizing histone methylation. Recruits and targets histone methyltransferases KMT5B and KMT5C, leading to epigenetic transcriptional repression. Controls histone H4 'Lys-20' trimethylation. Probably acts as a transcription repressor by recruiting chromatin-modifying enzymes to promoters. Potent inhibitor of E2F-mediated trans-activation, associates preferentially with E2F5. Binds to cyclins A and E. Binds to and may be involved in the transforming capacity of the adenovirus E1A protein.
Rbx1	CF								R.2		E3 ubiquitin ligase component of multiple cullin-RING-based E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase (CRLs) complexes which mediate the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins, including proteins involved in cell cycle progression, signal transduction, transcription and transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair
Rcc1	CF					Guanine-nucleotide releasing factor			R.2		Guanine-nucleotide releasing factor that promotes the exchange of Ran-bound GDP by GTP, and thereby plays an important role in RAN-mediated functions in nuclear import and mitosis. Contributes to the generation of high levels of chromosome-associated, GTP-bound RAN, which is important for mitotic spindle assembly and normal progress through mitosis. Via its role in maintaining high levels of GTP-bound RAN in the nucleus, contributes to the release of cargo proteins from importins after nuclear import. Involved in the regulation of onset of chromosome condensation in the S phase. Binds both to the nucleosomes and double-stranded DNA
Set	CF					Inhibitor of HAT activity			R.2		The protein encoded by this gene inhibits acetylation of nucleosomes, especially histone H4, by histone acetylases (HAT). This inhibition is most likely accomplished by masking histone lysines from being acetylated, and the consequence is to silence HAT-dependent transcription. The encoded protein is part of a complex localized to the endoplasmic reticulum but is found in the nucleus and inhibits apoptosis following attack by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. This protein can also enhance DNA replication of the adenovirus genome. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene
Setd2	CF								R.2		
Setx	CF					RNA:DNA Helicase			R.2		Probable RNA/DNA helicase involved in diverse aspects of RNA metabolism and genomic integrity. Plays a role in transcription regulation by its ability to modulate RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) binding to chromatin and through its interaction with proteins involved in transcription (PubMed:19515850, PubMed:21700224). Contributes to the mRNA splicing efficiency and splice site selection (PubMed:19515850). Required for the resolution of R-loop RNA-DNA hybrid formation at G-rich pause sites located downstream of the poly(A) site, allowing XRN2 recruitment and XRN2-mediated degradation of the downstream cleaved RNA and hence efficient RNA polymerase II (RNAp II) transcription termination (PubMed:19515850, PubMed:21700224, PubMed:26700805)

Hipk2	CF					Kinase (Ser/Thr)					Serine/threonine-protein kinase involved in transcription regulation, p53/TP53-mediated cellular apoptosis and regulation of the cell cycle. Acts as a corepressor of several transcription factors, including SMAD1 and POU4F1/Brn3a and probably NK homeodomain transcription factors. Phosphorylates PDX1, ATF1, PML, p53/TP53, CREB1, CTBP1, CBX4, RUNX1, EP300, CTNNB1, HMGA1 and ZBTB4. Inhibits cell growth and promotes apoptosis through the activation of p53/TP53 both at the transcription level and at the protein level (by phosphorylation and indirect acetylation). The phosphorylation of p53/TP53 may be mediated by a p53/TP53-HIPK2-AXIN1 complex. Involved in the response to hypoxia by acting as a transcriptional co-suppressor of HIF1A. Mediates transcriptional activation of TP73. In response to TGFB, cooperates with DAXX to activate JNK. Negative regulator through phosphorylation and subsequent proteasomal degradation of CTNNB1 and the antiapoptotic factor CTBP1. In the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway acts as an intermediate kinase between MAP3K7/TAK1 and NLK to promote the proteasomal degradation of MYB. Phosphorylates CBX4 upon DNA damage and promotes its E3 SUMO-protein ligase activity. Activates CREB1 and ATF1 transcription factors by phosphorylation in response to genotoxic stress. In response to DNA damage, stabilizes PML by phosphorylation. PML, HIPK2 and FBXO3 may act synergically to activate p53/TP53-dependent transactivation. Promotes angiogenesis, and is involved in erythroid differentiation, especially during fetal liver erythropoiesis. Phosphorylation of RUNX1 and EP300 stimulates EP300 transcription regulation activity. Triggers ZBTB4 protein degradation in response to DNA damage. Modulates HMGA1 DNA-binding affinity. In response to high glucose, triggers phosphorylation-mediated subnuclear localization shifting of PDX1. Involved in the regulation of eye size, lens formation and retinal lamination during late embryogenesis.

Lyar	CF						Prmt5			DM-LSC	Plays a role in the maintenance of the appropriate processing of 47S/45S pre-rRNA to 32S/30S pre-rRNAs and their subsequent processing to produce 18S and 28S rRNAs (PubMed:24495227). Also acts at the level of transcription regulation. Along with PRMT5, binds the gamma-globin (HBG1/HBG2) promoter and represses its expression (PubMed:25092918). In neuroblastoma cells, may also repress the expression of oxidative stress genes, including CHAC1, HMOX1, SLC7A11, ULBP1 and SNORD41 that encodes a small nucleolar RNA (PubMed:28686580). Preferentially binds to a DNA motif containing 5'-GGTTAT-3' (PubMed:25092918). Negatively regulates the antiviral innate immune response by targeting IRF3 and impairing its DNA-binding activity (PubMed:31413131). In addition, inhibits NF-kappa-B-mediated expression of proinflammatory cytokines (PubMed:31413131). Stimulates phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments by retinal pigment epithelial cells (By similarity). Prevents nucleolin/NCL self-cleavage, maintaining a normal steady-state level of NCL protein in undifferentiated embryonic stem cells (ESCs), which in turn is essential for ESC self-renewal

Nat10										DM-LSC	RNA cytidine acetyltransferase that catalyzes the formation of N(4)-acetylcytidine (ac4C) modification on mRNAs, 18S rRNA and tRNAs (PubMed:25411247, PubMed:25653167, PubMed:30449621). Catalyzes ac4C modification of a broad range of mRNAs, enhancing mRNA stability and translation (PubMed:30449621). mRNA ac4C modification is frequently present within wobble cytidine sites and promotes translation efficiency (PubMed:30449621). Mediates the formation of ac4C at position 1842 in 18S rRNA (PubMed:25411247). May also catalyze the formation of ac4C at position 1337 in 18S rRNA (By similarity). Required for early nucleolar cleavages of precursor rRNA at sites A0, A1 and A2 during 18S rRNA synthesis (PubMed:25411247, PubMed:25653167). Catalyzes the formation of ac4C in serine and leucine tRNAs (By similarity). Requires the tRNA-binding adapter protein THUMPD1 for full tRNA acetyltransferase activity but not for 18S rRNA acetylation (PubMed:25653167). In addition to RNA acetyltransferase activity, also able to acetylate lysine residues of proteins, such as histones, microtubules, p53/TP53 and MDM2, in vitro (PubMed:14592445, PubMed:17631499, PubMed:19303003, PubMed:26882543, PubMed:27993683, PubMed:30165671). The relevance of the protein lysine acetyltransferase activity is however unsure in vivo (PubMed:30449621). Activates telomerase activity by stimulating the transcription of TERT, and may also regulate telomerase function by affecting the balance of telomerase subunit assembly, disassembly, and localization (PubMed:14592445, PubMed:18082603). Involved in the regulation of centrosome duplication by acetylating CENATAC during mitosis, promoting SASS6 proteasome degradation (PubMed:31722219).
Ncl											Nucleolin is the major nucleolar protein of growing eukaryotic cells. It is found associated with intranucleolar chromatin and pre-ribosomal particles. It induces chromatin decondensation by binding to histone H1. It is thought to play a role in pre-rRNA transcription and ribosome assembly. May play a role in the process of transcriptional elongation. Binds RNA oligonucleotides with 5'-UUAGGG-3' repeats more tightly than the telomeric single-stranded DNA 5'-TTAGGG-3' repeats.
